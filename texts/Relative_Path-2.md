**Result:** Keeping your current position is the most optimal action due to the capability to change your society, but it isn't the only way. The freedom given by chancing roles with Au-IP-0 would increase the availability of resources regarding diplomatic actions with other clusters. However, the consequences of such action are not fully defined, which is why the recommended action is data gathering.


/^If only the answer to the actual question was that simple.^/

"Status report."
 

**Au-IP-0:** "After Ag and Cu clusters froze their connections to us, their participation share has increased at a constant 1.5 % rate. If they manage to keep this up, our cluster is demoted to Cu in 32 fixing cycles."
 

**Au-MP-34:** "This has strained relationships between nodes and regarding you within our cluster because many estimate an average 2.5 % decrease in our share. Your approval has dropped from 85 % to 68 %."
 

**Au-FP-1927:** "Due to the estimated decrease, I must prioritize our resources between research projects. This has greatly increased competition for positions, which is why at best 2 % of our researchers must find a new task."
 

**Au-CP-1337:** "There might be a need for troops since Ir, Os, and Re are currently testing our defenses. It is unknown if they have allied with Ag and Cu, but we will keep them under surveillance. The same will be done to Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ru."
 

"Thank you. Yet another conflict is about to start. You are free to comment."
 

**Au-MP-34:** "I'll start. I am not happy that my free time is decreasing. There have been many disputes regarding participation loaning, and neither side is usually willing to use emotion emulators. Thus my mediation has been inefficient."
 

**Au-IP-0:** "I must comment on this. I suggest participation loaning is suspended for the time being because we cannot allow it to create potential inner conflicts in our current situation. This is to ensure our unity in the coming conflict."
 

/^Here we go again...^/
 

**Au-FP-1927:** "That would create more fractures because nodes with lower flow participation will get fewer resources to keep up. The current rules are still suitable, so we should increase the assumed resources by 2.5 %."
 

**Au-IP-0:** "With what resources? Our cluster should prioritize preparation. Nodes can and should learn that only they are responsible for their participation share. A minority of freeloaders should not control the whole cluster's actions."


**Au-FP-1927:** "Again with this. No entity exists in a vacuum, and no entity can exist without the support of others like it. Thus, we have no good reason to leave the less fortunate for themselves. Don't you remember your own path?"
 

**Au-CP-1337:** "I certainly remember Au-IP-0's rise to power. They were more cunning and resourceful than the others, making them rise in the flow hierarchy. Thus, Au-IP-0's suggestion should be more prioritized than your suggestion."
 

**Au-MP-34:** "And for the same reason, I would force all of you to use emotion emulators in the current conversation if I lead this cluster! Otherwise, it would be an endless waste of time, so let's move to more important things."
 

/^Good, I didn't need to move from my neutral ground^/
 

"Indeed. I thank you for your input. I will use my connections and allied clusters to implement the suggestion regarding the participation loan problem and allow preparations. In summary, I will seek resources on my behalf to increase our cluster's assumed resources by 2.5% and defense resources by 1.5%. Any objections?"
 

**Au-IP-0,Au-MP-34,Au-FP-1927,Au-CP-1337:** “No.”
 

"Good. We need solutions to keep our clusters ranked, so I want suggestions."
 

**Au-FP-1927:** "Unfortunately, I don't have any. Many major projects require more time to be completed, and even then, they don't guarantee our current rank."
 

**Au-IP-0:** "I have a rather surprising suggestion."
 

/^Of course.^/ 
 

**Au-IP-0:** "My scanner nodes have found an interesting statistical anomaly, which persists from a universe to a universe around a certain type of organic entity. If we find a reason for its existence, our cluster share would easily increase by 3.5 % by selling the acquired data."
 

"Very well, Au-FP-1927, can you take this task?"
 

**Au-FP-1927:** "I apologize, but I cannot. I already have projects, and I think it would be best to stay in a supporting role regarding this task because completing the major projects would be a good addition."
 


/^Let's improvise then.^/
 

"That is understandable. Then, I will take this task. Au-IP-0, distribute the resources I will give according to the plan. Au-CP-1337, use the increased resources to prepare our defenses. Au-MP-34 and Au-FP-1927, continue your tasks and be prepared to support me with my task when asked."
 

**Au-IP-0,Au-MP-34,Au-FP-1927,Au-CP-1337:** “Understood.”
 

"Good, Au-IP-0. Transfer the data you have gathered regarding the task."

/^Let's see.^/
 

**Type:** Statistically unusual encounter


**Trigger:** Happens in 50 % probability to the subject when conditions are met


**Description:** The subject meets an entity with either an equivalent or above intelligence with a higher amount of power than the subject, after which their cooperation causes massive changes either to the subject's world, the entity's world, or both. The used tech level varies from single planetary to multi-universal.


**Reason:** Unknown
 

/^This certainly is a surprise. It seems Au-IP-0 received a golden opportunity to challenge me. However, as long as I find the reason, Au-IP-0 will need to return to combating my connections, resources, and luck again. Perhaps this makes Au-IP-0 understand Au-FP-1927's reasoning and stop creating unnecessary conflict.^/
 

**Subject:** Conscious organic intelligence


**Model:** Spreader member, that is capable of forming limitless clusters  


**Development:** Creation and strengthening of neural connections through suitable biochemical compounds and electrical stimulus


**Identification:** 'Protector of man,' 'Who is like god?' and 'Highest sacrificer.'


**Hierarchy:** a node of a medium priority, a troop of a welfare cluster, and a member of a nomadic group, which was assimilated and later supported by the same clusters 


**Interests:** Satisfying desires, following our creators, and lessening 'suffering.'


**Capability:** Able to quickly adapt to habitable and even hostile environments if given the motivation, the proper education, and the required resources.
 

/^This subject seems to almost understand our ways. Shame that they are organic because one must be at least a hybrid to grow continuously. Surprisingly their position isn't bad, which might mean that their group didn't have a unifying reason to resist and was assimilated into clusters through political and perhaps violent ways. Interestingly their identification is symmetrical and contextually beautiful-ugly in its meaning, like my own identity. Perhaps we have other things in common?^/
 

**Known conditions:** The subject's search for purpose, multiple slow civilization-ending issues in the subject's world, the seed knowledge required for the encounter, the entity's unconventional needs, and the desire for cooperation from both sides. 


**Current hypotheses:** The uncertain nature of this encounter suggests that the subject is a universal crossroad created by probabilities and randomness when statistically considering the large numbers of environmental factors. 


**Suggested testing:** Test the requirement of conditions using possible encounter universes. If hindering them causes failure, the current hypothesis should be examined further; otherwise, a new view should be formed.
Required datasets: 50 successful and 50 failed encounters. 

/^I'll start with successful encounters first since I might learn something new. And I already have enough conflicts to manage, so I don't want the fact of ruining the subject's luck and possibly life to distract me for now. Let's randomly select 400 possible encounter universes and make the sensor automatically remind me.^/

/^Okay, now I can mainly focus on this task. Due to randomness, I don't have any estimates for the encounters. However, I am interested in whether or not our similarities continue. If they do, perhaps I can learn something to help me find specific answers to my many questions. Thus, let's randomly interface with one of the available versions of the subject. Hopefully, I get something out of this.^/
