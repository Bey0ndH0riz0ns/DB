# Primer

Creation is generally a resource-intensive and challenging process, but in the case of art, it is also embarrassing. For this reason, completing a piece is hard since there are always what-ifs that can make the creator reconsider. Thus, a creator must have a plan to follow to quiet these thoughts, which is why let's examine the inspiration, the structure, and the purpose of the Relative Path.

The inspiration of Relative Path is divided into main sources and side sources. Main sources are definitive, which is why the story will use some of their ideas and refer to them directly. Side sources constantly change, so the story might use them for support and refer to them in passing. Side sources are listed in a separate file, and I will now go through the main sources concerning their roles.

My stories intend to create simulations with feelings or scenarios, which help the reader learn and consider practical ideas. For this reason, I will use Yuval Noah Harari's style of inspecting the objective-intersubjective-subjective dimensions [1] and Bertolt Brecht's epic theater techniques [2] to create the dimensional writing style, which in Relative Path will describe the changing first-person views.

The protagonists of this story will try to be their best versions regardless of the odds, but this conflicts with their pasts, desires, expectations, and 'selves.' Due to being personally interesting protagonists, Hachiman's journey to a healthier mindset [3] and the flat circle of punishment Alevian experiences [4] inspires Relative Path's protagonists to learn to suffer.   

The antagonists of this story will be either the logical conclusions of their redundant ideologies, critics with justified reasons, or both. I am interested in the latter,  which is why The Major's mission for a glorious death due to an assholish perspective on humanity [5] and Senator Armstrong's hypocritical Darwinist dream to make America great again [6] will be templates for Relative Path's antagonists.

The plot of this story intends to explore the workings and intermingling of tech, stories, and multiple universes. Thus, I will use the idea of justified and potential societies constructed with tech like soma [7] and the crash and rebuilding of the status quo by allowing entities like the war economy pursuing world marshal and the corrupted empire to interact [8], which ought to make Relative Path enjoyable.    

The theming of this story will be of cooperation, change, and acceptance in cold and uncaring universes. My favorite themes are Madoka's and Homura's universe chancing dance of dualistic selfishness [9] and the presence of humanity motivating and cursing machines and androids to wage an eternal and cyclical war against each other [10]. These are the origins of the depression in the Relative Path.    

The world in this story is an ongoing process of probabilities and randomness, where only the entities capable of controlling it to adaptable levels survive. I will use the potentially fast and sometimes luck-driven brutality of a battlefield [11] and the chaotic positives and negatives encountered in the daily life of the futuristic wild west [12] to make these attributes exist throughout Relative Path.      

The vibe in this story will be a combination of freedom, campiness, and enjoyment, which tries to be equal to the story's darkness. To succeed, I will use Ailu Valle's tone chancing [13] and S3RL's experimental mixing [14] to create the dimensional wording style. In Relative Path, it conveys how a character views the world in a way they can understand and engage with it.

The violence in this story will aim to be realistic, brutal, and fluid in either group vs. group, group vs. individual, or individual vs. individual engagements. My favorite kind of violence is both satisfying and practical, which is why the near future conquests of Islands [15] and the lonely journey of a dull blade to achieve disarmament in mythical lands [16] will inspire the last measure in Relative Path.       

The comedy in this story will use personalities, relationships, and group dynamics to create relatable, absurd, or exaggerated characterization, situations, and contexts. I am inspired by a rich megalomaniac attempting to beat cheating pharao in a children's card game [17] and a group voicing over occasionally cringe visual novels while having fun chatting [18], which is why Relative Path tries to be funny.     

My stories intend to use controlled dissonance, which allows free exploration of characters, ideologies, or cultures but grounds itself on the point of view and current reality. To succeed in this, I will use the nightlife of a yakuza thug roped into a political conspiracy [19] and a simulated man's torments in the hands of a live audience [20] as examples to make Relative Path both meta and sincere. 

The structure of Relative Path uses ten main events, different side events, and character arcs to reach the end, but otherwise, there is no grand plan. This means the story will be character-driven, while the main and side events will aim to create exciting contexts and environments for the characters to either spectate or participate, hopefully making Relative Path feel organic in its progression.

The purpose of Relative Path is to be the first fictional representation of my ideas, be a foundational way for me to collect data about the experiences my readers feel during my stories, and be an advancing step in my attempts to automatize story creation. As a person aiming to specialize in AI, I hope my readers help in the second case, but as long as this story is worth your time, I will be satisfied.

We have gone through the Relative Path's inspiration, structure, and purpose. I went through different sources and the roles of the main sources. I planned the story to be character-driven, with events as building blocks. I told that Relative Path is my first public story, an attempt to data-mine feelings and a step to automize writing. I will use these plans to write this story, which tries to be worth your time.
